        </h1>
        <p>
            <strong>The NBA or National Basketball Association- is known as one of the <br>
                best sports in the world, American professional basketball league (NBA)</strong>.<br>
            The NBA was founded in New York on June 6, 1946 as the Basketball <br>
            Association of America. It adopted its current name in 1949, after<br>
            the union of several clubs from the defunct National Basketball League.<br>
            The opening game was a New York Knicks - Toronto Huskies, on November 1,<br>
            1946. The first game was seen by 7,090 spectators.

                <em>REGULAR SEASON</em>
            </h2>
            <p>
                In the regular season each team plays 82 games, divided equally between home<br>
                and away games. The calendar is not the same for everyone. Teams meet<br>
                opponents from their own division four times; before those of the other<br>
                two divisions of his conference, three or four times; and against those<br>
                of the other conference, twice a year.29 Therefore, a team can have an<br>
                easy or difficult schedule, depending on the division or conference in<br>
                which it is located. After recent NHL schedule format changes, basketball<br>
                is the only top-tier American league where all franchises play each other<br>
                during the regular season, and where a season ticket guarantees you being<br>
                able to see your team every time they come to town to play during the regular<br>
                season.

                <em>POSTSEASON</em>
            </h3>
            <p>
                The NBA Playoffs consist of four rounds of competition between sixteen <br>
                teams divided into the Western Conference and the Eastern Conference, <br>
                eight teams from each Conference. The winners of the First Round <br>
                (or conference quarterfinals) advance to the Conference Semifinals, <br>
                then to the Conference Finals, and the winners to the NBA Finals, played <br>
                between the champions of each conference.
            </p>
            <h4>
                <em>FINALS</em>
            </h4>
            <p>
                In the final round, the champions of each conference meet in the best <br>
                of seven games. The first to win in four games will be known as the <br>
                NBA champion. It is contested annually in June, and the champion has <br>
                been awarded the Larry O'Brien Championship Trophy since 1977, when it <br>
                replaced the Walter A. Brown Trophy.34 The idea of calling the Larry <br>
                O'Brien Championship Trophy, is in honor of David Stern's predecessor NBA <br>
                commissioner, Larry O'Brien. Each player on the winning team, as well as <br>
                the coach and general manager, is awarded a champion's ring.
